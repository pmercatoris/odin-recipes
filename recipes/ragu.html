		</p>

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>400g coarsely ground beef</li>
			<li>150g fresh pork pancetta, sliced</li>
			<li>60g onion (half an onion)</li>
			<li>60g carrot (one carrot)</li>
			<li>60g celery (one stalk)</li>
			<li>1 glass of red or white wine</li>
			<li>200g tomato purée</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
			<li>1 glass whole milk (optional)</li>
			<li>Light meat or vegetable broth (can use bouillon)</li>
			<li>3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
			<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				In a heavy non-stick or enamelled cast iron pan (traditionally a 24-26
				cm terracotta pot was used), melt the chopped pancetta with 3
				tablespoons of oil.
			</li>
			<li>
				Finely chop the onion, carrot, and celery (do not use a mixer) and add
				to the pancetta. Sauté slowly over medium-low heat, stirring constantly
				with a wooden spoon until the vegetables are softened. Avoid browning
				the onion.
			</li>
			<li>
				Increase the heat and add the ground beef. Cook for about ten minutes,
				stirring constantly, until the meat sizzles.
			</li>
			<li>
				Add the wine and let it evaporate completely until there is no wine
				aroma. Then, add the tomato paste and purée, mixing well.
			</li>
			<li>
				Add a cup of hot broth (or water) and simmer covered for about 2 hours
				(up to 3 hours depending on preference and type of meat), adding more
				hot broth as needed.
			</li>
			<li>
				Halfway through the cooking time, optionally add the milk and let it be
				absorbed completely. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper at the
				end of cooking. The ragù should be a rich dark orange color, creamy and
				well-blended.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Notes</h2>
		<p>
			Traditionally, the "cartella" (beef diaphragm) was used, which is hard to
			find today. Alternatively, cuts rich in collagen such as muscle, shoulder,
			chuck, flank, and brisket are preferred. Mixed meats can also be used. A
			modern method suggests browning the meat separately and then combining it
			with the sautéed vegetables.
		</p>

		<h2>Permitted Variations</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Mixed meats: 60% beef and 40% pork (loin or neck)</li>
			<li>Hand-chopped meat</li>
			<li>Flat or rolled pancetta instead of fresh pancetta</li>
			<li>A hint of nutmeg</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Prohibited Variations</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Veal</li>
			<li>Smoked pancetta</li>
			<li>Only pork meat</li>
			<li>Garlic, rosemary, parsley, other herbs or spices</li>
			<li>Brandy instead of wine</li>
			<li>Flour (to thicken)</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Enhancements</h2>

			<li>Crumbled pork sausage</li>
			<li>Blanched peas added at the end of cooking</li>
			<li>Rehydrated dried porcini mushrooms</li>
		</ul>
