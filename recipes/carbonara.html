<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
	<li>500g of spaghetti</li>
	<li>2l of water</li>
	<li>8g of salt</li>
	<li>200g of guanciale (or cured bacon)</li>
	<li>4 egg yolks</li>
	<li>30g of parmesan</li>
	<li>20g of pecorino</li>
	<li>Black pepper</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
	<li>
		We chop the bacon into thick cubes and put it in a pan (no added fat). We
		leave it on low heat until it is crispy on the outside and tender on the
		inside. At that time, we drain the fat and reserve.
	</li>
	<li>
		We put the water on the fire with the salt. When it boils, we add the
		spaghetti and leave them for the time indicated by the manufacturer. About
		eight minutes.
	</li>
	<li>
		Meanwhile, in a bowl we mix, with the help of the rods, the egg yolks, the
		grated cheeses and a little pepper. When the pasta is almost ready, we add a
		little cooking water and beat well.
	</li>
	<li>
		When the pasta is ready, we pour it into the bowl, draining it previously. A
		good way is to use long tongs for the whole process. We add the guancale, a
		little more pepper and some of the bacon fat. We mix well and serve
		immediately.
