	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>
		This recipe is from Vito Iacopelli, a pizza chef from Naples, Italy (<a
			href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7Hd6ZzKgBM&t"
			>Youtube</a
		>). The idea is to use 1kg of flour to make 6 pizza dough balls. The recipe
		is divided into two parts: the poolish and the pizza dough. The poolish is a
		pre-ferment that will give the dough a better flavor and consistency. The
		pizza dough is the final dough that will be used to make the pizza. The
		dough is made with a high hydration level, which makes it very soft and easy
		to stretch. The dough is then left to rest in the fridge for 16 to 24 hours.
		After that, the dough is divided into balls and left to rest for 2 to 4
		hours at room temperature. The dough is then ready to be used to make pizza.
		The recipe is very simple and easy to make, and the result is a delicious
		and authentic Neapolitan pizza.

	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<h3>Poolish</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>300ml Water</li>
		<li>300gr Flour</li>
		<li>5gr Yeast</li>
		<li>5gr Honey</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Pizza Dough</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>400ml Water</li>
		<li>700gr Flour</li>
		<li>30gr Salt</li>
		<li>10gr Olive Oil</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Instructions</h2>
	<h3>Poolish</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>
			In a large bowl, mix the water, honey, and yeast until the yeast is
			dissolved.
		</li>
		<li>Add the flour and mix until well combined and smooth.</li>
		<li>
			Cover the bowl and let the mixture rest at room temperature for 1 hour.
		</li>
		<li>
			After 1 hour, place the bowl in the fridge and let it ferment for 16 to 24
			hours.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Pizza Dough</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Remove the poolish from the fridge and let it come to room temperature for
			about 30 minutes.
		</li>
		<li>
			In a large mixing bowl or stand mixer, combine the poolish with 400ml of
			water. Mix until the poolish is fully dissolved in the water.
		</li>
		<li>Add the salt to the mixture and mix until it is dissolved.</li>
		<li>Add the flour gradually while mixing until a dough starts to form.</li>
		<li>
			Once the dough starts to come together, add the olive oil and continue to
			knead until the dough is smooth and elastic. This can take about 10-15
			minutes by hand or less with a mixer.
		</li>
		<li>
			Shape the dough into a ball and place it in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover
			and let it rest for 15-20 minutes.
		</li>
		<li>
			After resting, fold the dough to strengthen the gluten. Use a bit of olive
			oil on your hands to prevent sticking and gently stretch and fold the
			dough.
		</li>
		<li>
			Place the dough back into the bowl, cover it, and let it rest for another
			15-20 minutes.
		</li>
		<li>
			Repeat the stretching and folding process once more. Then, shape the dough
			into a ball again, place it in an oiled bowl, cover it, and refrigerate
			for 16 to 24 hours.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Shaping and Baking</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Remove the dough from the fridge and let it come to room temperature for
			30 minutes to 1 hour.
		</li>
		<li>
			Lightly flour your work surface and gently remove the dough from the bowl.
		</li>
		<li>
			Divide the dough into portions (each dough ball should weigh around 250
			grams for a standard pizza).
		</li>
		<li>
			Shape each portion into a smooth ball by pulling the edges into the center
			and pinching them together. Place the dough balls seam-side down in a
			floured container.
		</li>
		<li>
			Let the dough balls rest at room temperature for 2 to 4 hours until they
			have doubled in size and are ready to be stretched.
		</li>
		<li>
			Preheat your oven to its highest temperature, ideally with a pizza stone
			inside, for at least one hour before baking.
		</li>
		<li>
			To shape the pizzas, gently press and stretch each dough ball on a floured
			surface, leaving the edge slightly thicker to form the crust.
		</li>
		<li>
			Top your pizzas with desired toppings and transfer them onto a floured
			pizza peel.
		</li>
		<li>
			Slide the pizzas onto the hot pizza stone and bake for 8-10 minutes or
			until the crust is golden and the toppings are cooked.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Notes</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			If using dry yeast instead of fresh yeast, reduce the amount to 5 grams
			for the poolish.
		</li>
		<li>
			If you don't have 00 flour, all-purpose flour can be used as a substitute,
			though the texture may vary slightly.
		</li>
		<li>
			The dough can be made by hand or with a stand mixer. Adjust kneading times
			accordingly.
		</li>
		<li>
			To achieve the best results, use a pizza stone or steel in your oven and
			ensure it is thoroughly preheated.
		</li>
